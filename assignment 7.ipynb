    "   Removing variables with weak evidence\n",
    "   Keeping only significant categorical indicators \n",
    "- This represents a shift from including all possible predictors to focusing on those with strong statistical evidence\n",

    "2) Model6 → Model7 Evolution:\n",
    "- Model6 has independent linear effects\n",
    "- Model7 introduces interactions between continuous variables:\n",
    "   Changes from separate terms \n",
    "   To interaction terms \n",
    "- Keeps the same significant categorical indicators\n",

    "1) metrics measure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R-squared (17.6%) measures the overall proportion of variance in the outcome that is explained by ALL predictors together in the model\n",
    "- P-values measure the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis that an individual coefficient equals zero\n",
    "- Coefficients represent the estimated change in the outcome associated with a one-unit change in a predictor, holding other predictors constant\n",
    "\n",
    "2) contradictory:\n",
    "- Low R-squared suggests the model as a whole doesn't explain much variability\n",
    "- Strong evidence against null hypotheses (low p-values) suggests we're confident about non-zero relationships\n",
    "- Large coefficients suggest substantively important relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Key insight: These metrics address different aspects of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "A) R-squared addresses overall model fit:\n",
    "- A low R-squared means there's still a lot of unexplained variation\n",
    "- This could happen if:\n",
    "  - Important predictors are missing\n",
    "  - The relationship is genuinely noisy\n",
    "  - The functional form isn't quite right\n",
    "\n",
    "B) P-values address confidence in coefficient estimates:\n",
    "- Small p-values mean we have strong evidence the true coefficient isn't zero\n",
    "- This can happen even with noisy data if we have:\n",
    "  - Large sample size\n",
    "  - Clear directional patterns despite noise\n",
    "  - Low correlation between predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Example to illustrate:\n",
    "Imagine predicting student test scores:\n",
    "- We might find that study hours strongly predict scores (low p-value, large coefficient)\n",
    "- But scores still vary a lot because many other factors matter (sleep, interest, etc.)\n",
    "- Result: Clear relationship (significant coefficient) but lots of unexplained variation (low R²)\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Not contradictory because:\n",
    "- R-squared measures how close our predictions are to actual values\n",
    "- P-values measure how confident we are that relationships exist\n",
    "- Coefficients measure the magnitude of those relationships\n",
    "- These can all tell different parts of the story simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Statistical interpretation:\n",
    "- We can be very confident a relationship exists (low p-value)\n",
    "- The relationship can be substantively important (large coefficient)\n",
    "- But still leave much variation unexplained (low R-squared)\n",
    "- This often happens in social/behavioral sciences where many unmeasured factors affect outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "they help us understand:\n",
    "- How much variation we explain overall (R-squared)\n",
    "- Which specific relationships we're confident about (p-values)\n",
    "- How large those relationships are (coefficients)\n",

    "1) Time-Based vs Random Split Testing:\n",
    "- The original analysis used random train-test splits\n",
    "- The new analysis uses a more realistic time-based approach:\n",
    "   Using Generation 1 to predict later generations\n",
    "   Using Generations 1-5 to predict Generation 6\n",
    "- This reflects real-world scenario where we use historical data to predict future outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Model Performance Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model7 (Complex):\n",
    "- Higher R² in random split testing\n",
    "- But shows worse generalization in time-based testing\n",
    "- Four-way interactions make interpretation difficult\n",
    "- Many coefficients have weak statistical evidence (high p-values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Model6 (Simpler):\n",
    "- Slightly lower R² in random split testing\n",
    "- More stable performance in time-based testing\n",
    "- More interpretable (direct effects + selected indicators)\n",
    "- Stronger statistical evidence for coefficients\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Key Lesson:\n",
    "The analysis reveals that Model6, despite being \"simpler,\" is actually preferable because:\n",
    "- Better interpretability\n",
    "- More reliable generalization across generations\n",
    "- Stronger statistical evidence for relationships\n",
    "- More parsimonious (fewer, more meaningful parameters)"
